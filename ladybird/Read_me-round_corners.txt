Firefox / Mozilla users can have rounded corners on the entry and sidebar boxes if they choose. This feature is not yet supported in other browsers. 

If you would like to have rounded corners just 
rename 'style.css' as 'style.css.sq' 
and rename 
'style.css.round_corners' as 'style.css' 
then upload the 'Ladybird' folder to your 'templates' folder.
